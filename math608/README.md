During the class, the usual homework assignment would have one written question that we would have to submit on the due date in class (which I don't have my work for unfortunately) as well as one or two programming questions that we'd submit online in Canvas. 

The work you're seeing in this folder is, for the most part, correct. There were some minor issues with my code that led to some small inaccuracies in my work, but I usually got a score of 18-20/20 on the programming section. 

I unfortunately can't find the original prompts that the homework solutions were answering.
